parse for words
for each word
	- toss if number
	- toss if teaspoon, tablespoon, tsp, tbl, cup, quart, pint, pound, lb, oz
	- if those are found, then rest of line is going to be the ingredient
	- look for the ingredient in the database list of ingredients
	- if found, add to list
	- if not, add to list of potential ingredients (for training)	
		- potential ingredients should be displayed to users so they can decide which ones to use

- build list
	- hopefully with some sort of cool css/formatting
